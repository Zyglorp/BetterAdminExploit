this is the fastest way that you can get admin rights at work,school,etc in only a few steps :)

First, you have to create an USB bootable image of Windows 10 using RUFUS.

--->(Search on the internet a .iso file of Windows 10)<---

after that, simply open the USB's directory and put all these files in the ROOT folder.
there are a few steps to follow in order to do this trick, but it's really simple, follow me :)
P.S. you can also execute the commands one-by-one but this may take much more time than these simple files to execute.

1  -  plug the usb into the target pc and enter the BIOS, you can use the f2 f8 f10 f11 ecc combinations,
      or you can just reboot your pc normally, but keep pressed the SHIFT key to boot into the "problem solving" screen 
      where you have to press on it and press on the bottom right button to open the BIOS/UEFI settings
      
2  -  go to the boot section and put your USB in the upper position, then save and exit.

3  -  once you booted into your USB, you should see the "Windows Installer Window", just click on next or continue

4  -  now, do you see a big button at the center of the screen? Well, don't click it.
      instead you have to click on "restore computer".
      
5  -  click on Problem Solving (the wrench and the screwdriver)

6  -  click on "Command Prompt" to open the command prompt, you would never have said that, huh?

7  -  find your USB drive letter, so try the alphabet until you enter the USB

8  -  it's time to execute the first script, so type " 1 " (without the quotation marks and spaces)
      
      REMOVE YOUR USB BEFORE THE MANIFACTURER LOGO APPEARS
      
9  -  when the login screen appears, press any key and click on the small accessibility icon

10 -  if you are on windows 10, type " 2 " and you're done
      if you are on windows 8 or 8.1, you have to type " w8 " and follow the steps
      
11 -  Now login into your basic account, open the USB stick folder and execute " 3.exe " 

12 -  YOU DID IT! now you've successfully restored all the original files, BUT now you have admin rights! 
      when any program asks for admin, you just have to type " admin "
      
   If you're on a domain pc:
      
      [COMPUTERNAME]\admin and as password "admin" or the one you have set up at step 10
      
   If you're on a single pc out of the domain:
      
      you need to type admin as usename and "admin" as password or the one you have set up at step 10
