## WAE - Windows Admin Exploit by DaddyParodz & MaRCoilBRaZ

this is the fastest way you can get admin rights at work,school,etc in only a few steps :)

First, you need to create a Windows install USB. You have 2 ways: create a bootable Windows 10 USB with the media creation tool

OR 

Search on the internet a .iso file of Windows 10 and flashing it with using RUFUS.

after that, simply open the USB's directory and put all these files in the ROOT folder. there are a few steps to follow in order to do this trick, but it's really simple, follow me :) P.S. you can also execute the commands one-by-one but this may take much more time than these simple files to execute.

1.  plug the usb into the target pc and enter the BIOS, you can use the f2 f8 f10 f11 ecc combinations, or you can just reboot your pc normally, but keeping pressed the SHIFT key when clicking on "reboot" to boot into the "problem solving" screen where you have to press on it and press on the button to open the BIOS/UEFI settings.

2.  go to the boot section and put your USB in the upper position, then save and exit. (or you can just use "boot override" if you don't want to change boot order)

3.  once you booted into your USB, you should see the "Windows Installer Window", just click on next or continue

4.  now, do you see a big button at the center of the screen? Well, don't click it. instead you have to click on "restore computer " on the bottom left.

5.  click on Problem Solving (the wrench and the screwdriver)

6.  click on "Command Prompt" to open the cmd, you would never have said that, huh?

7.  find your USB drive letter, so try the alphabet until you enter the USB.

8.  found the drive letter of the coolest usb ever? confirm it with the "dir" command to get a list of the files inside of it. Now execute the all-in-one script "adminexploit.bat" (yes, it's a .bat so you can actually see and edit what it does.)

9.  press 1 and enter for the first step. It does a bunch of stuff, it just covers your ass in case something goes wrong, no worries. When it's done, PRESS ANY KEY, wait for the timer to end and before your pc reboots, remove the usb. 

10.  when the login screen appears, press any key and click on the small accessibility icon to open the cmd you just created.

11.  reconnect and get into the usb again, same as step 7

12.  execute adminexploit.bat again and this time press 2. Two windows should appear, one is the cmd where you have to type the commands manually because windows sucks and doesn't let them run automatically ,and the other one is a simple text file from which you have to copy those two commands, adding the name and password you want where they need to be set and then adding (with the second command) the account you just created to the "Administrators" localgroup.

13.  If everything went correctly, you should have the cmd saying "press a key to continue" and then it closes by itself. Cool, but you're not done yet.

14.  now, in the cmd left open, execute "taskkill /F /IM LogonUI.exe" or you can just reboot the pc. This will reload the login screen and hide every window opened.

15.  Perfect! You should see in the bottom right corner the username you created in step 2! Click on it and type in your beautiful password.

     P.S. If you're on a domain pc, like at school or work there the accounts are managed by a server you have to type this in order to login with a LOCAL ACCOUNT:
     "COMPUTERNAME[BACKSLASH][USERNAME]" (without quotation marks) as user and your password. Example: Computer name is "test", so "test\admin" as username.

16.  DONE! Check if you have admin privileges by pressing on start > account icon > change account settings. If it says Local Account - Administrator, you are now admin! 

17.  The last thing you have to do is execute for the last time the adminexploit.bat script and select the 3rd option to restore the original Utilman.

18.  Thank us later with a STAR on GitHub, it would make us proud of our work :)
