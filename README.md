# BetterAdminExploit (credit to daddyparodz for original)
blah blah blah, exploit was fixed by windows, this nests the "exploit" inside of task manager instead 
go read the original version for instructions, after that you should be able to do this
(changed utilman.exe to sethc.exe so press shift 5 times at start instead of whatever it was and also changed cmd to Task Manager to avoid detection)
